SAMSUNG Galaxy A50s (Prism Crush Violet, 128 GB)  (4 GB RAM),₹21,070,Bibekananda Rath,5,Classy product,Beyond expectation in this price range. After using Honor / Redmi Note 5 / Vivo /Oppo F9 Pro...now I found why Samsung is the king above all smartphone. In future I will be prefer to buy a Samsung mobile phone rather then any available Chinese toyz. The Display and the Samsung UI are awesome. The most important is no unwanted notifications. It feels more secure over what I have used earlier.
